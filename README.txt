Atrack: An Ntrack Implementation
===============================

Atrack is a minimalist implementation of the Ntrack protocol (see ntrac.txt)
designed for usage with Google's App Engine.


Setup Instructions
------------------

Create an App Engine application, change the 'application' name in app.yaml to
match your app name, edit static/index.html to suit your taste and to mention
the address of your tracker. Deploy with appcfg.py! You are done!
