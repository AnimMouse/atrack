<h1 class="front"> Welcome to the running instance of Atrack, </h1>
<h1 class="center"> a torrent tracker designed to run in Google <a href="https://atrack-torrent-tracker.appspot.com/">App Engine</a>.</h1>
<hr />
<h2 class="center"> News: </h2>
<h3> June 8, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Successful deployment on Google App Engine. </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Tracker has been listed on newTrackon. </h3>
<h3> June 9, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> As the tracker is getting errors when ipv6 address are handled, the DNS CNAME record (ghs.googlehosted.com) was changed to the 4 IP address used in naked domain. </h3>
<h3> June 11, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Changed tracker interval from 180 mins (3 hrs) to 60 mins (1 hr). </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Because the 4 IP address are getting latency when accessed in different parts of the world, a solution was found to change the DNS A records to the CNAME record of ghs4.googlehosted.com. </h3>
<h3> June 12, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Successful deployment of this news site </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Changed tracker interval from 60 mins (1 hrs) to 30 mins. </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Because the word "ntrack" is also used in the program that edits audio, we desided to move domain from ntrack.tk to track.ga. </h3>
<h3> June 13, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Because the program exceeded the free quata, the tracker is down for 4 hours, we enabled billing to prevent service interruption. </h3>
<h3 class="center"> We moved the php redirect to another project to prevent consuming the instance hours. </h3>
<h3 class="center"> We temporary shutdown instance 2 to prevent hitting quata. </h3>
<h3> June 14, 2018 </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Instance 2 has been converted to back-end instance. </h3>
<h3 class="center"> Added the original favicon. </h3>
