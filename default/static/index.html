<h3> All instances are running on Atrack v0.9.10 since June 8, 2018 </h3>
<h3> Note: Clicking on the link above on a browser will just redirect you to this site, unless if the instance is experiencing over quata. </h3>
<h3> Note: This program is still in its beta stage and has not been updated since October 30, 2009. </h3>
<h3> Note: This program does not yet handle ipv6, because of that, AAAA records are removed. </h3>
<h3> Note: For privacy and efficiency reasons, atrack does not (yet?) implement the "scrape" protocol and other non-essential BT features, so you wont see the number of seeders and leechers available in this tracker, this doesn't mean they aren't there, but atrack doesn't keep track (pun not intended) of that information. </h3>
